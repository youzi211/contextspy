# Development

## Backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RimantasZ/contextspy.git
cd contextspy
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn contextspy.api.main:create_app --factory --reload --port 5173
```

## Tests

Backend tests cover adapters/classification, invocation normalization, WebSocket assembly,
database migrations, and request filtering. Frontend tests cover request tables/filters, the
request workbench and block maps, content search, theme behavior, and tool-treemap transformation.
Run them with:

```bash
pytest
# or a single test:
pytest tests/test_providers.py::test_name

cd ui
npm test

# Run the complete UI validation suite (types, lint, tests, unused code, build)
npm run check
```

When modifying `analysis/adapters/`, `analysis/classifier.py`, normalization, capture, database, or
proxy protocol code, run the backend suite. Run the frontend suite and build after UI changes.

## Frontend

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev   # Vite dev server on :5174, proxies /api (including /api/ws) to :5173
```

The built UI is embedded in the Python package at `contextspy/_web/`. Rebuild after
changing anything under `ui/src/`:

```bash
cd ui && npm run build   # outputs to contextspy/_web/
```

## Architecture

### Cloud mode

```
coding agent → HTTPS_PROXY → mitmproxy (port 8888)
                                  │
                            ContextSpyAddon (intercepts here)
                              → match provider route, endpoint, and protocol
                              → read admitted request/response bodies
                              → identify one provider invocation
                              → normalize provider state into canonical JSON
                              → parse canonical request/response JSON only
                              → classify tokens into 8 categories
                              → write to SQLite
                              → broadcast via WebSocket
                                  │ TLS terminate + forward
                              cloud LLM API
```

### Local mode

```
client (base_url=:8889) → mitmproxy reverse proxy (port 8889)
                                  │ plain HTTP forward
                            llama-server / Ollama / vLLM (port 8080…)
                                  │
                            ContextSpyAddon (per-target fixed ProviderRoute;
                                              provider is the stored label)
                              → capture/reconstruct, parse, classify, count tokens
                              → write to SQLite
                              → broadcast via WebSocket
```

Both modes share the same FastAPI web server (port 5173), SQLite database, dashboard, and
startup-built provider registry. The registry also drives PAC generation; unmatched hosts,
unsupported endpoints, and disallowed protocols are forwarded without reading their bodies.

## Data storage

All data is stored in `~/.contextspy/`:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.contextspy/contextspy.db` | SQLite database — all requests and sessions |
| `~/.contextspy/config.toml` | Configuration file (auto-created on first run) |

Observed request payloads, canonical request/response payloads, normalized SSE/NDJSON/WebSocket
event logs, plus the content-addressed `block_contents` table (see below), become eligible for
purging 7 days after capture by default to limit disk usage — configurable via
`[retention]` in `config.toml` (`raw_body_days`, `block_content_days`; `0` disables purging).
Purging only runs once, at server startup — there is no background timer, so a `contextspy`
process left running for many days won't purge again until restarted.

### Capture and analysis boundary

Transport ingestion first identifies one externally observable provider invocation. HTTP has one
request/response pair; a registered WebSocket protocol opens an invocation on its provider start
event and closes it on a terminal event. Deltas and utility frames never become request rows.

Provider normalization then produces a standalone `CanonicalInvocation`. For Responses API
traffic, an explicit `previous_response_id` is resolved to a persisted predecessor and the visible
input is expanded as predecessor input + predecessor output + current input. This applies to REST
as well as WebSocket traffic. Only explicit provider IDs establish lineage.

`canonical_request_body` and `canonical_response_body` store the exact JSON documents passed to
the provider adapter. Blocks and category/token columns are derived indexes over those documents;
they intentionally duplicate data. A retained canonical pair is sufficient to rerun analysis
without replaying transport events. `raw_request_body` and `response_events` remain diagnostic
evidence, while `raw_response_body` is retained as a compatibility field.

Reconstruction and block-analysis failures are recorded in `capture_error` without discarding the
canonical application payload. The UI's JSON is provider-level application content, not
byte-identical compressed/chunked network traffic.

The user-facing behavior and storage implications are described in
[REST, streaming, and WebSocket request handling](transport-normalization.md).

### Context fidelity

Each invocation records one of three fidelity states:

- `complete`: the request was observed in full or its visible lineage was expanded through exact
  provider IDs;
- `partial`: a required predecessor was missing or purged;
- `opaque`: compaction, encryption, truncation, or another provider-side representation prevents
  inspection of some content.

Provider-reported usage remains authoritative in every case. Locally tokenized composition
explains the visible canonical JSON; the signed difference can also contain provider-tokenizer or
server-transformation effects, so it is labelled as unattributed/tokenizer difference rather than
invented hidden content. These limits apply to provider-managed REST conversations too, not only
WebSockets.

### Blocks

Every successfully analyzed request/response is also decomposed into `blocks` — one row per
content part (system prompt, tool definition, a single tool call or tool result, a text or
thinking segment, ...).
Each block's semantic `category` (one of the 8 breakdown categories) and structural `block_type`
are kept forever; only the block's `content` (in `block_contents`, deduplicated by content hash
across requests) is subject to the retention window above.

## Token estimation accuracy

Token counts are **estimates** using tiktoken `o200k_base` encoding
(`analysis/tokenizer.py: ENCODING_NAME`).

| Provider | Expected error |
|----------|----------------|
| OpenAI (GPT-5.x, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, o-series) | ~2% — `o200k_base` is these models' native encoder |
| OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo) | ~2–5% — these predate `o200k_base` and use `cl100k_base` natively |
| Anthropic (Claude) | ~15–30% — see below |
| Ollama / llama.cpp / vLLM | ~10–20% |

When the provider reports exact token counts in the API response, those are stored
alongside the estimate and shown on the request detail page for comparison.

Inline image, audio, document, and other media payloads need different accounting. A base64 data
URL is only a transport encoding; the provider does not tokenize those characters as prompt text.
ContextSpy therefore replaces media parts with short typed markers in analyzed blocks and marks
mixed blocks with `contains_media` plus `token_estimate: text_only`. The canonical request still
retains the original payload for raw inspection. For multimodal requests, use the provider-reported
input total as the authoritative total because the local estimate covers the visible text but not
provider-specific media tokens.

### Encoder choice, and the 0.3.4 switch

ContextSpy counted with `cl100k_base` up to 0.3.3 and with `o200k_base` from 0.3.4 onwards.
`cl100k_base` is native only to GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo; every OpenAI model released since
GPT-4o — the whole GPT-5.x line, GPT-4.1, the o-series — uses `o200k_base`, so the old
default was an approximation for essentially all current traffic.

The switch was made for correctness, not accuracy: it changes which models the counts are
exact for, not the counts themselves. Re-encoding the captured corpus (~200 KB of real
system prompts, tool definitions, tool results and reasoning) under both encoders gives
totals within **0.0%** of each other, with no category off by more than 3.6%:

| Content kind | `cl100k_base` | `o200k_base` | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool results | 17,228 | 17,234 | +0.0% |
| Tool definitions | 10,706 | 10,726 | +0.2% |
| System prompt | 8,228 | 8,221 | −0.1% |
| Thinking | 7,925 | 7,860 | −0.8% |
| Conversation history | 2,541 | 2,560 | +0.7% |
| **All content** | **48,953** | **48,936** | **−0.0%** |

The efficiency gap `o200k_base` is known for shows up on natural language, especially
non-English — not on the English prose, code and JSON that dominate a coding agent's
context. It does nothing for Anthropic, whose tokenizer matches neither encoder.

Every `Request` records which encoder produced its counts in the `tokenizer` column
(`tiktoken/o200k_base`, or `tiktoken/cl100k_base` for rows captured before 0.3.4). Existing
rows are **not** recounted — there is no migration, because the raw bodies needed to redo the
work are purged on the retention schedule. Sessions spanning the upgrade therefore mix both,
which given the ~0.0% difference is immaterial in aggregate but is recorded per row should it
ever matter.

### Anthropic tokenizer drift

Anthropic's tokenizer has diverged from `cl100k_base` and now produces materially more
tokens for the same text. Recent Claude requests measured against the provider's own
`usage` show ContextSpy's estimate running **roughly 13–39% low** (small sample of
`claude-haiku-4-5` turns), well outside the ~5–15% this table used to quote. The estimate
is always the low side — tiktoken undercounts, it does not overcount.

This affects the *input* categories too, not just output: every category in the context
breakdown is understated by roughly the same proportion, so the *shares* between categories
stay meaningful even when the absolute numbers are low. Where an exact number matters, use
the provider-reported figures on the request detail page.

It compounds in the `derived` reasoning case below, where the estimate is subtracted from a
provider-reported total — there the whole error is concentrated into the thinking figure
rather than spread across the response.

### Thinking / reasoning tokens

Reasoning is billed by every provider but disclosed by only some, so
`analysis/adapters/base.py: reconcile_thinking()` normalises all of them onto the same
carriers — `thinking` blocks for the text, `provider_reasoning_tokens` for the provider's
own figure — and tags each block with `attrs["token_source"]` recording how it was arrived at:

| `token_source` | When | Accuracy |
|----------------|------|----------|
| `provider` | The API reports a reasoning count (OpenAI `reasoning_tokens`) | Usually exact — but see the Codex caveat below |
| `estimated` | No count, but the text came back (Anthropic `display: "summarized"`, Ollama `thinking`, DeepSeek/vLLM `reasoning_content`) | Same band as the table above |
| `derived` | Neither count nor text (Anthropic `display: "omitted"` — the default on current Claude models — and `redacted_thinking`) | Residual of `output_tokens` minus the estimated visible output |
| `unknown` | Nothing to go on (no count, no text, no `output_tokens`) | Reported as 0 |

The `derived` case matters most in practice: Anthropic's Messages API bills thinking inside
`output_tokens` and never breaks it out under any `thinking.display` setting, so subtraction is
the only signal available. Because the visible side of that subtraction is a tiktoken estimate
against a different tokenizer, **all of its error lands on the thinking figure** — and since
tiktoken tends to undercount Claude's tokenizer, `derived` thinking skews high.

Getting the reasoning *text* captured moves a request off `derived` and onto the more accurate
`estimated` path. For Claude Code that means `"showThinkingSummaries": true` in
`~/.claude/settings.json`; other agents expose it as a `thinking.display: "summarized"` request
parameter. Either way ContextSpy only records what the provider chose to send.

**Codex on a ChatGPT plan — `reasoning_tokens` can describe only the summary.** On the
`chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` endpoint, the reported `reasoning_tokens` sometimes
covers just the short reasoning summary rather than the hidden reasoning that was actually
billed. Because `provider` outranks every other source, that figure is taken at face value and
the remainder is not attributed anywhere — the request's totals then fall short of
`output_tokens` with no category to account for the difference. Most turns reconcile to within
a few tokens; the failure mode is a turn with heavy hidden reasoning behind a one-line summary
(one observed example: 29 visible + 444 reported reasoning against 2,535 billed output tokens,
leaving 2,062 unaccounted). Compare **Tokens out** with the provider figure on the request
detail page to spot it.
