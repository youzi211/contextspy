# Cloud API Mode (Forward Proxy)

Use this mode to intercept requests going to supported **cloud LLM APIs** such as OpenAI,
Anthropic (Claude), Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, opencode's gateway, and the ChatGPT backend
used by Codex CLI.

ContextSpy acts as an HTTPS man-in-the-middle proxy. It terminates TLS, inspects the
request, logs and analyses it, then re-encrypts and forwards it to the provider.

## Prerequisites

- ContextSpy installed — see [Installation](install.md)
- CA certificate installed in your OS trust store — see [CA certificate setup](install.md#ca-certificate-setup-cloudforward-proxy-mode-only)

---

## Step 1 — Start ContextSpy

```bash
contextspy start
```

This starts:
- HTTPS forward proxy on **port 8888**
- Web dashboard on **port 5173** (opens automatically in your browser)

Options:
```
--proxy-port  PORT   Proxy listen port (default: 8888)
--web-port    PORT   Dashboard port (default: 5173)
--no-browser         Don't open the browser automatically
```

### Optional — configure a custom provider route

Built-in provider hosts work without configuration. To capture a custom or enterprise gateway,
add a `[[provider_routes]]` block to `~/.contextspy/config.toml` before starting ContextSpy:

```toml
[[provider_routes]]
host = "gateway.example.com"
provider = "enterprise_gateway"
include_subdomains = false
allowed_protocols = ["openai_chat", "openai_responses"]
```

`host` must be a bare hostname without a scheme, port, path, or wildcard, and cannot duplicate a
built-in or configured host. `provider` is the label stored with captured requests and must match
`[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`. `include_subdomains = true` also matches subdomains. Omit `allowed_protocols`
to allow every registered protocol, or set a non-empty list containing any of `anthropic`,
`openai_chat`, `openai_responses`, and `ollama`. Configured hosts and their subdomain settings are
included in the PAC file served at `/api/proxy.pac`.

The legacy `[intercepted_hosts].extra_hosts` setting is no longer accepted when non-empty. Convert
each host to a `[[provider_routes]]` block and assign an explicit `provider` label.

## Step 2 — Configure your agent

There are two options here:
- use a ContextSpy runner - limited to agents you can launch from command line (simpler and preferred) 
- setup environment variables and agent configuration manually

### Using a ContextSpy runner

Launch the agent using the `contextspy run <agent> <path>` command

```bash
contextspy run claude <path to project>        # launches the claude agent, replace placeholder with your project path
contextspy run code ~/code/my-secret-project  # launches vscode with my-secret-project open
contextspy run opencode .                      # launches opencode with the current directory open 
```

This will set up necessary environment variables and launch the agent - it will work with most IDEs and agents that can pick up HTTPS_PROXY environment variable, and route LLM requests through it.

For some node.js based apps (e.g. VS Code), you will need to close all instances of the app before running this command - as if the process is already running, it will not honor proxy settings from the environment variables.

### Manual setup - agent specific

Pick the agent you use and follow the instructions below.
Run `contextspy setup-<agent>` for a printed reminder at any time.

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

**Option A — VS Code `settings.json`** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Open User Settings JSON"):

```json
{
  "http.proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
  "http.proxyStrictSSL": false
}
```

**Option B — environment variables** (set before launching VS Code):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem

# PowerShell
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
$env:NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS = "$env:USERPROFILE\.mitmproxy\mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem"
```

```bash
contextspy setup-copilot   # prints the exact snippet
```

### Claude CLI / Claude Code

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem

# PowerShell
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
$env:NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS = "$env:USERPROFILE\.mitmproxy\mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem"
```

> `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` is required because Claude CLI is an Electron/Node app with its
> own bundled certificate store that ignores the OS trust store.

```bash
contextspy setup-claude
```

**Optional — see the reasoning text.** Current Claude models withhold thinking text by
default, so the request detail page's **Response** composition shows a Thinking block with a
token count but no content. To capture the text as well, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "showThinkingSummaries": true
}
```

Thinking *tokens* are captured either way — see the
[FAQ](faq.md#a-thinking-block-shows-a-token-count-but-no-reasoning-text).

### opencode

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888
export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem

# PowerShell
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
$env:SSL_CERT_FILE = "$env:USERPROFILE\.mitmproxy\mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem"
$env:NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS = "$env:USERPROFILE\.mitmproxy\mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem"
```

> opencode uses both the Go TLS stack (`SSL_CERT_FILE`) and Node.js components
> (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`), so both variables are needed.

```bash
contextspy setup-opencode
```

### Codex CLI

> This section covers **Codex CLI** (the terminal tool) only. The ChatGPT desktop app is a
> separate application and is not supported by ContextSpy.

```bash
# Preferred
contextspy run codex .

# Or manually (macOS / Linux)
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888
export NO_PROXY="github.com,localhost,127.0.0.1,::1"

# PowerShell
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
$env:NO_PROXY = "github.com,localhost,127.0.0.1,::1"
```

> Codex loads proxy settings from `~/.codex/.env` after launch, overriding the
> environment set by `contextspy run`. Remove `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and
> `ALL_PROXY` entries from that file before using the runner. If this machine
> needs another proxy for internet access, set `[proxy].upstream_url` in
> `~/.contextspy/config.toml` (for example `http://127.0.0.1:7890`).
> To capture an internal gateway through ContextSpy without that upstream,
> start with `contextspy start --direct`. If Codex connects directly to the
> gateway without passing through ContextSpy at all, no traffic can be captured.

If you're logged in via a **ChatGPT plan** (rather than an API key), Codex defaults to a
WebSocket transport for its private `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` endpoint.
ContextSpy captures this natively (see the [FAQ](faq.md)) — those turns show up in the dashboard
with a **WS** badge instead of an HTTP status code, with token counts and category breakdown
populated the same as any other request. No config changes are needed.

> If you previously added a `chatgpt_http` `model_provider` block to `~/.codex/config.toml` to
> force plain HTTPS (a community workaround for the earlier lack of WebSocket support), it's no
> longer needed and can be removed. It still works if left in place.

```bash
contextspy setup-codex
```

### Python / OpenAI SDK / httpx scripts

```python
import os
os.environ["HTTPS_PROXY"] = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
```

Or as environment variables:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888 python your_script.py

# PowerShell
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
python your_script.py
```

### Cursor

Cursor respects VS Code's proxy settings. Add to your Cursor `settings.json` (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Open User Settings JSON"):

```json
{
  "http.proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
  "http.proxyStrictSSL": false
}
```

### Generic (curl, httpx CLI, etc.)

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888

# PowerShell
$env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
$env:HTTP_PROXY  = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"
```

## Step 3 — Use the dashboard

Open http://127.0.0.1:5173. Requests appear in real-time as your agent makes LLM calls.

- **Overview** — token totals, category/tool composition, sessions, models, latency/errors, and
  recent requests
- **All Requests** — searchable/filterable request list with token counts and category bars
- **Sessions** — group requests by task; click **Start session** and give it a name
